            <p class="p">Ever since I was young, I always interested in math!<br> And one day, when I was watching a math tutorial video. <br>I got the idea of creating a website, full of tutorials’ videos and tips. <br>That’s will be wonderful for us! Sadly, some people are scared of Math <br>so I would love to vanish the fear of Math! And in the future also in our website,<br> not only Math and English, we’ll be including more subjects!</p>

In the future, we’ll be coming up with more ideas!</p>

                <p class="p">Ever since I was a kid, I have dreamed of making my own website and sharing tips to students <br>so that they could somehow get benefits from the website. Now I have finally got the chance to create a self study website for <br>secondary students explaining the tips, videos together with pictures to have a good impact on the student's studies.</p>

And yet, that’s how I got the idea to create this website.</p>
